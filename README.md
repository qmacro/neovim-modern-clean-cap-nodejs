# A working modern and clean config for editing CAP Node.js sources in Neovim

This repo accompanies the blog post [A modern and clean Neovim setup for CAP Node.js - configuration and diagnostics](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2025/06/10/a-modern-and-clean-neovim-setup-for-cap-node.js-configuration-and-diagnostics/) and provides a dev container definition for an environment with Neovim (0.11+) and the configuration in the blog post, along with CAP Node.js too.

The idea is that you can try out what you read in the blog post by starting up a CodeSpace here on GitHub:

![codespace startup](assets/create-codespace-on-main.png)

> Remember to delete your CodeSpace when you're done!

Then you can use the CodeSpace, specifically the shell that it makes available, to run Neovim and try out the features described and configured.
